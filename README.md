The program works like the robotic hoover Roomba.
The room has dimensions X and Y.
There are patches on specific places, that the hoover has to 'clean'.
Once cleaned, the spot is clear.

The program gets the dimensions of the room, the patches locations and the direction
and counts the number of patches and the last place of the hoover.
